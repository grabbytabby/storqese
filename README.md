Physico-chemical stability of these bioactive compounds and nutraceuticals are significantly affected by the harsh environmental condition during production, processing, and storage. In the meantime, due to the physiological conditions generated within the body system during digestion and absorption, the organic functions of bioactive compounds are altered. With an ever-rising demand for healthy foodstuff, substantial interest has been drawn to renovating food processing technologies to build up novel, purposeful, or functional food products with enhanced health benefits. In this perception, nanotechnology or nanofabricated bioactive compounds/nutraceuticals with superior delivery strategies have been launched in the field of the food sector to improve the biological efficacy and physicochemical stability of naturally available bioactive compounds/Nutraceuticals in food and also to shield the food quality [1,3]. Nanofabrication is a promising and exceptional tool in food biotechnology to augment the efficiency of biomolecules in the past, present, and future.
